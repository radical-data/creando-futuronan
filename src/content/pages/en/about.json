    "heading": "Our Story",
    "content": "Creando was created through collaboration between artists, organisers, and collectives who have lived the gap in access to design and digital culture education in Aruba. Many had to leave for the Netherlands to study and sustain their practice.\n\nThese shared experiences brought us together to connect existing efforts on the island and build something new from within."

  "ourApproach": {
    "heading": "Our Approach",
    "content": "Our approach is hands-on and collaborative: learning by doing, experimenting, and building together. We connect creative practice with local culture, sustainability, and the Caribbean's unique way of seeing and making.\n\nCreando is part school, part laboratory, and part community space — a place where young people can develop the skills, confidence, and networks to imagine and build the futures they want, right here in the Caribbean."
