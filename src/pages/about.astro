      <p>
        Creando is a practical school for creativity, built from the ground up
        in Aruba.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe education should grow from the realities, needs, and dreams
        of the people who live here, not from imported models.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creando was created through collaboration between artists, organisers,
        and collectives who have lived the gap in access to design and digital
        culture education in Aruba. Many had to leave for the Netherlands to
        study and sustain their practice. These shared experiences brought us
        together to connect existing efforts on the island and build something
        new from within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach is hands-on and collaborative: learning by doing,
        experimenting, and building together. We connect creative practice with
        local culture, sustainability, and the Caribbean’s unique way of seeing
        and making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creando is part school, part laboratory, and part community space — a
        place where young people can develop the skills, confidence, and
        networks to imagine and build the futures they want, right here in the
        Caribbean.

        redefine the role of technology in our present and future. Rayén Jara
        Mitrovich is a Chilean artist, activist and researcher whose work
        focuses on intimacy, bodies and their interaction with technology. Jo
        Jara Kroese is an English-Dutch mathematician, artist and technologist.
        Their work uses data and technology to create tools for resistance and
        real utopias.

        and cultural narratives within the Caribbean. Focusing predominantly on
        the ABC-SSS islands and the diaspora, C/N seeks to create space for
        local oral (hi)stories and knowledge often overlooked or marginalised
        within formal institutions, and foster inclusive, community-driven
        storytelling and knowledge-sharing.
