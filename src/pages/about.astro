            <p>
              Creando was created through collaboration between artists, organisers,
              and collectives who have lived the gap in access to design and digital
              culture education in Aruba. Many had to leave for the Netherlands to
              study and sustain their practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              These shared experiences brought us together to connect existing efforts 
              on the island and build something new from within.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h2 class="h2 mb-4">Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Our approach is hands-on and collaborative: learning by doing,
              experimenting, and building together. We connect creative practice with
              local culture, sustainability, and the Caribbean's unique way of seeing
              and making.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creando is part school, part laboratory, and part community space — a
              place where young people can develop the skills, confidence, and
              networks to imagine and build the futures they want, right here in the
              Caribbean.
